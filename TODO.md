# High Priority:
- ~~In the Skinning methods change the 'TransformVector' functions. This will have to be handled by the shader so it should be calculated manually.~~


# Low Priority:
- Build skeleton not from the root joint but from the positions/rotations of the joints (coupled with the joint ids/names). In the proper use case I will probably not have the hierarchy available.
